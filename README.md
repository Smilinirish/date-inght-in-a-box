#<Date-Night-in-a-Box>

##Date Night in a Box is a one stop shop for a night on the town. The user enters their zipcode, mile radius and selects either a movie theater, resturant or gallery which then displays the closest venue of their choosing. The venue along with the venue ratings, photo, contact information and a map with directions are displayed. The user is able to click through multiple results. We decided to build this app because we wanted to be able to plan out an evening without having to switch between multiple apps.

##Date Night in a Box uses both Google Maps Embeded and Yelp APIs.
